                Just for fun, I used AI to create a simple cover-based shooter.
                Here's what we got:
                <ul>
                    <li>A very basic cover generator system that spawns covers and calculates possible cover points</li>
                    <li>Combat decision logic that helps pawns find the best cover based on the current state of the battlefield</li>
                    <li>A simple weapon system that fires projectiles with spread</li>
                    <li>A custom sight system for pawns. I was truly shocked that such an essential feature as sensing enemies is so poorly implemented in Unreal Engine. It deserves a separate post. ðŸ˜„</li>
                    <li>A basic pawn that is capable of holding a weapon and using all the systems above to defeat its enemy</li>
                </ul>
                Things to improve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple pawns try to take the same cover, so they become easy targets</li>
                    <li>Friendly fire; nobody cares about killing an ally</li>
                    <li>Pawns always try to get new cover instead of holding a good position</li>
                    <li>Weapon reloading would add some tactical moments</li>
                    <li>More weapons and shields would also add more tactical options</li>
                </ul>
