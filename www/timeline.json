In those first days, it was hard to gather my thoughts, so we tried to help the army and restore bomb shelters.<br/>Since we were young parents, my wife set up a shared children's area in the shelter so that kids had something to do during air raids.<br/>At first, I looked for ways to be usefulâ€”buying first aid kits, pouches, power banks, and thermal imagers. Over time, I found my niche: 3D printing for the army's needs."],
